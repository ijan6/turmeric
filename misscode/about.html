        It’s a place where you can enjoy the best coffee in town, meet new friends, and have fun. We started our coffee shop in 2023, after traveling around the world and discovering the amazing diversity and richness of coffee culture.

        We roast our own coffee in small batches and brew it with care and precision. We also offer a variety of delicious and healthy food options, such as sandwiches, salads, soups, and desserts. Whether you need a quick pick-me-up, a relaxing break, or a productive work session, Bean There, Done That is the place for you.
